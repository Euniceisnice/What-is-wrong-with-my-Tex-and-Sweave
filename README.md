# What-is-wrong-with-my-Tex-and-Sweave
I have problems using Rstudio Sweave while compiling with Knitr. I have MacTex installed on my Mac and Tex Live installed on my Win 11. When I tried to compile this Rnw file to PDF, I have different problems.

**Problems when using Tex Live + Sweave (Knitr) on Win 11 - Tex Capacity exceed**
I found "texmf.cnf" but I did not manage to edit it. This is not a read-only file but the folder is. I tried to change it but it automatically changed it back immediately.
There is no big plot in this Rnw.file.
Compiling with Sweave does not have problems. But I need Knitr. I just need highlight in the codes in that PDF.

**Problems when using Tex Live + Sweave (Knitr) on Mac -
Package fontenc Error: Encoding file 't2aenc.def' not found.
Package fontenc Error: Encoding file 'ly1enc.def' not found.
Latex Error: File 'xstring.sty' not found.**

**----------update----------**
The problems on Mac became "incompatible color definition".
